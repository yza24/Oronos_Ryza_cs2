        There are different types of dining, for example, Common dining area, a central location in a group residence where people gather to eat at mealtime. <br>
        Casual dining restaurant is a full-service concept with a laid-back, comfortable, family-friendly ambiance and an affordable menu; <br>
        a fine dining restaurant has an upscale ambiance, a dress code, a chef-curated highly-priced menu, and service held to the "white tablecloth" standard.

        Fine dining restaurants offer diners an upscale meal experience often comprising several courses 
        (e.g., salad, appetizer, entree, dessert). These types of restaurants try to create a stylish <br>
        atmosphere that speaks of elegance, exclusivity, and class. Fine dining establishments can operate 
        as a franchise for broader appeal or as a single location to increase their sophisticated image.

        Casual dining types of restaurants usually share the following characteristics: <br>
    <br>
        *Customers are served at their table <br>
        *Food offerings are moderately priced <br>
        *Atmosphere is low-key <br>
        *Decor is often unique and based on the type of food served <br>
    <br>
        As a general rule, casual dining restaurants fall between fine dining and fast casual on <br>
        the “fancy” spectrum.

        Fast casual restaurants cater to customers who are looking for fare that is relatively 
        quick yet, at the same time, healthier than fast food and more affordable than a casual <br>
        dining establishment. As such, fast casual types of restaurants offer quality food, 
        counter service (as opposed to table service), and a more casual, contemporary style and decor.

        Fast food is the most widely recognized type of restaurant thanks to franchise chains 
        like Taco Bell, Burger King, and KFC. Fast food restaurants attract diners because of <br>
        their price, convenience, and speed. Because of this focus, ingredients in fast food
        restaurants are usually preheated or precooked (though not always). Food is then delivered <br>
        over the counter — or through a drive-thru window — and customers seat themselves.

        Food trucks, carts, or stands are unique modern businesses that normally specialize in a 
        single type of food (e.g., tacos, sandwiches, hot dogs, ice cream, smoothies, etc.) and <br>
        serve a limited menu that revolves around those items. They are generally categorized 
        together with fast food restaurants because the focus is on speed. Additionally, seating <br>
        options may be sparse or even non-existent.

    <p style=font-size:large;" align="center">
        This type of restaurant is characterized by fried foods (e.g. chicken and fish), burgers, 
        and breakfast items served at low cost. Many diners were open 24 hours and featured <br>
        booths and table service as well as a long bar with stools at which patrons could sit and 
        receive their food straight from the kitchen. Diners with a nostalgic theme — and even <br>
        high-quality and high-priced fare — are becoming more common in downtown areas as employees 
        at nearby businesses discover the benefits and convenience of leaving the office for lunch <br>
        and an occasional break.
