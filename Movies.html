    <h3 style="font-size: 30px;"> What are Movie Genres?</h3>
    <p style=font-size:large;" align="center">
        Movie genres are categories that define films based on narrative or stylistic elements. The genre of a film can help determine the characters, <br>
        setting, plot structure, and tone. Action films, for example, typically include fight scenes and slow-motion camera shots. Horror films often <br>
        feature jump scares and have more action than dialogue.
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">13 Different Types Of Movie Genres:</h3>
    <br>
    <h4 style="font-size: 25px;" align="center">Action Genre</h4>

    </div>
    <p style=font-size:large;" align="center">
        Movies in the action genre are fast-paced and include a lot of action like fight scenes, chase scenes, 
        and slow-motion shots. <br> They can feature superheroes, martial arts, or exciting stunts. These high-octane 
        films are more about the execution of the plot rather than the plot itself. Action movies are thrilling <br>
        to watch and leave audience members on the edge of their seats. Visit website to see a list of <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/g39654001/best-action-movies-2022/" target="_blank">Action Movies </a> <br>

    <p style=font-size:large;" align="center">
        The adventure genre is so similar to the action genre that the billing for adventure films is sometimes 
        action/adventure movies. Films in the adventure genre usually contain the same basic genre elements as <br>
        an action movie, with the setting as the critical difference. Adventure movies are typically set in an 
        exotic, far away, or unfamiliar locale. Visit website to see a list of <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://www.moviefone.com/movies/2022/adventure/" target="_blank">Adventure Movies </a> <br>

        Comedy films are funny and entertaining. The films in this genre center around a comedic premise—usually 
        putting someone in a challenging, amusing, or humorous situation they’re not prepared to handle. <br>
        Good comedy movies are less about making constant jokes and more about presenting a universally relatable, 
        real-life story with complex characters who learn an important lesson. Visit website to see a list of <br>

        The drama genre features stories with high stakes and many conflicts. They’re plot-driven and demand that 
        every character and scene move the story forward. Dramas follow a clearly defined narrative plot structure, <br>
        portraying real-life scenarios or extreme situations with emotionally-driven characters. Films that fall 
        into drama sub-genres include historical drama or costume drama, romantic drama, teen drama, medical drama, etc. <br>

        Films in the fantasy genre feature magical and supernatural elements that do not exist in the real world. 
        Although some films juxtapose a real-world setting with fantastical elements, many create entirely imaginary <br>
        universes with their own laws, logic, and populations of imaginary races and creatures. Like science fiction 
        films, fantasy films are speculative but unrelated to reality or scientific fact. High fantasy, fairy tales, <br>
        and magical realism are all fantasy subgenres. Visit website to see a list of <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://www.moviefone.com/movies/2022/fantasy/" target="_blank">Fantasy Movies </a> that you might like to watch.
