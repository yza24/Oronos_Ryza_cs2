        - A movie is a film that you watch at a theater or at home on your TV, laptop, or 
        tablet. Movie is short for "moving picture," which was pretty exciting in the late <br> 
        1800s. Some people like to see new films at the theater as soon as they're released. 
        However, movies can affect society in both positive and negative ways. They can help <br>
        the economy grow, inspire individuals, and expand our basic knowledge of the world 
        around us. Movies can also create violence and bad habits, can make people greedier, <br>
        and can send a bad message to the public. It's up to people how they'll use the knowledge 
        they learned after watching a movie but the bright side is, it gaves enjoyment and entertainment to people. <br>
