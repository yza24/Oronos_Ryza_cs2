        Specific mediums and forms of artistic expression have changed throughout human history, but for the most part, art falls into one of the following seven classical forms. <br>
        Each different form of art is experienced differently and affects our emotions and feelings. 
    </p>
    <h3 style="font-size: 30px;">7 Different Forms of Art:</h3>
    <br>
    <h4 style="font-size: 25px;" align="center">Painting</h4>

        <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/art/top-famous-paintings-in-art-history-ranked" target="_blank">Painting </a> is what most minds jump to when we think of art. Painting is the most commonly <br>
        taught art medium in childhood education. Paintings are classified by both the subject 
        matter, style, and genre. Painting subjects usually fall into still life, landscape, <br>
        seascape, portraiture, or abstract. There are many painting styles, including modernist, 
        expressionist, classical, surreal, cubist, Chinese style, abstract, impressionist, and many more.

        <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://www.timeout.com/newyork/art/top-famous-sculptures-of-all-time" target="_blank">Sculpture </a> is another ancient visual art form that dates back to prehistoric times. <br>
        A sculpture creates three-dimensional visual images, traditionally using materials 
        such as clay, stone, ceramics, metals, or wood. However, modern sculptors have almost <br>
        any object at their disposal to create a sculpture, including metals, plastics, glass, 
        or found objects.

    <p style="font-size: large;" align="center">
        <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://oedb.org/ilibrarian/50_books_that_changed_the_world/" target="_blank">Literature </a> is an art form that shares stories. It is an art form of language and can be <br>
        read or spoken. The Concise Oxford Dictionary defines literature as “writings whose value 
        lies in the beauty of form or emotional effect.” Writers create art with literature through <br>
        the organization of words that give pleasure, and while reading is enjoyable, those words 
        are often critiques of society.

        <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://www.goconstruct.org/why-choose-construction/whats-happening-in-construction/top-20-famous-buildings-across-the-world/" target="_blank">Architecture </a> is the art form you pass every day without realizing or fully appreciating <br>
        it as an art form. Architecture is the art of structures, and we could reasonably date 
        architecture back to the point when man first created shelter. <br>
        However, the more common perception of architecture as an art form relates to just a <br>
        handful of buildings that are particularly beautiful or awe-inspiring.

        <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://mubi.com/lists/cinemas-greatest-art" target="_blank">Cinema </a> is the newest of the seven forms of art. Created just over a century ago, <br>
        cinema may not have the length of history as the other art forms on this list, 
        but it has quickly become one of the most popular. Cinema has quickly advanced <br>
        to become the large industry we now know today. The movie industry employs artisans 
        in special effects, animation, makeup, costumes, writing, set design, score, acting, <br>
        directing, and more.

        <a style="font-size: large;" href="https://www.musicgrotto.com/best-songs-of-all-time/" target="_blank">Music </a> is the art of arranging audible sounds and vibrations to produce a musical <br>
        composition using the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. Music can 
        use the human voice, instruments, or both. Music is more difficult to date than <br>
        the visual arts, but it’s believed that vocal sounds played an essential role in 
        humankind’s early communication before speech development. There is evidence that <br>
        our ancient ancestors crafted musical instruments using wood, bones, stones, and <br>
        other natural materials.

        performance. Over time the definition of theatre has broadened to include 
        performance art. Usually, it includes different art forms where the artist or <br>
        artists present or perform their art on a stage. Theater often incorporates the 
        other seven different forms of art in its total package, with music, set design, <br>
        and literature often used as elements of theater production.
